    "summary_of_events": "The airship Hindenburg caught fire and burned while being moored at Lakehurst, New Jersey.  Possible causes were static discharge which ignited leaking hydrogen or sabotage. It has been theorized that a sudden turn just before landing caused a steel cable to snap which punctured one of the hydrogen airbags. Thereafter, when mooring ropes were dropped to the ground, the cage was discharged setting up a static discharge between the Hindenburg's outer skin and frame causing the hydrogen to ignite."
